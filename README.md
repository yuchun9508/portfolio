# My Portfolio Website V2 :raised_hands:

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my latest portfolio website built with [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Giving my first try to Tailwind CSS, and I found it truly helpful to establish a structured styling system easily and quickly :heart:

## Getting started
- `npm install -g @vue/cli`
- `npm install`
- `npm run serve` compiles and hot-reloads for development
- `npm run build` compiles and minifies for production

## What I used 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Meta](https://vue-meta.nuxtjs.org/)
- [Prerender SPA Plugin](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
